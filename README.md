# Anomabot

A gimmicky (currently private) Discord bot made using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## What does it do?

The available commands are
- `^nato [encode | decode] [message]` - encode/decode a message in the NATO phonetic alphabet
- `^vigenere [k | p | c] [keyword] [plaintext]` - encode a message using a Vigenere cipher
- `^leetcode` - grab a random [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem

## Can I play with it on my server?

For now, the answer is no. In the future, this may change.
