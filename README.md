# Anomabot

A gimmicky (private) Discord bot made using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## What does it do?

Not much at this point. More features are coming soon, but so far we have
- `^nato [encode | decode] [message]` - encode/decode a message in the NATO phonetic alphabet

## Can I play with it on my server?

Not likely, but more on this later.
